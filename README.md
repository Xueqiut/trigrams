# trigrams
# Next Steps
* Build Mock framework to test DB connection and to build Integration Test (patially fix)
* Move DB connection credentials to environment variable or secret store 
* Support upload multiple files
* Refind method to better clean text file content
* Avoid upload the same file into the DB
* Implement server side authentification. Based on who the client is, we could use JWT or client certificate.
* Add support to return number of trigrams (what does number of trigrams mean?)
